IPv6 Attacks

    Current go-to because it is reliable 

    Good chance that IPv6 is turned on but almost completely not used  

        Nobody is doing DNS for IPv6  

        Can give us auth to the domain control  

        Gives up NTLM and we LDAP to the DM and login with it  

            Use mtm6 to do all the above stuff
