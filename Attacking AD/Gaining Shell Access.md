Gaining Shell Access

    So far we only have a user cred 

    With Metasploit you can the username and password you can use psexec to give you some priv-es ideas  

        Might need to change the target  

    Meterperter might get blocked  

        Do psexec.py (out of Metasploit) 

        Also try smbexec or wmiexec  

            Start with these since these are 'quieter' shells  

            Good start to see if there's an antivirus and see if you can disable this
