Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads 

    Payload: what we run via an exploit  

        Windows/linux type payload 

        Python type paylload  

    Staged 

        Sends the payload in staged  

        Can be less stable  

        Windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 

    Non-Staged 

        Sends it all at once  

        Larger in size and won't always work  

        Windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp 

            Lack of the forward slash  

    If you think your exploit should work maybe try the other type of payload
